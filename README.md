Coming into the industry as a beginner, but a passionate one! My love for computers, programming, and science has led me here. Currently I am attending 
a private bootcamp for software engineering, and am also in CC for my CompTIA cybersecurity certifications to explore that field a bit, and learn how to 
build more secure software!

My plans are big, and my hope is to eventually help better humanity and our beautiful planet in some way or another by using technology and software for
good, rather than harm. My past professional history outside of computer science shows that I am a driven, hard-working, and passionate individual. 

If you are looking for a junior dev/engineer to add to your team, or have an open-source project that you need to recruit some people for, message me
and let us see where it takes us! We all need that one person or company to give us our chance in the industry, and I am looking for that right now!
